    My work is, as my name, sometimes debatable...

<p>
  I've had the fortune of making my personal interest in software development into a career.
</p>

I believe in open source and am in awe of the responsibility developers take on their code created in the public space. I can't imagine where we'd been if it wasn't for open source. Because of this I'd like to do my part.

I'm a Jack of all trades and master of none which reflects on my contributions in the open source community. The majority of my work has been done in the .NET ecosystem, but there are contributions in JavaScript/TypeScript as well. A couple of my projects have been successful, and they currently have millions of downloads and hundreds of GitHub stars. A few of them are showcased in reference applications created by Microsoft.

Please get in touch with me if you have any questions regarding my work, either by opening an issue on one of my projects, or by contacting me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattiaskindborg/).
